# Changelog

All notable changes to AgentClaw are recorded here. Dates are ISO (YYYY-MM-DD).

## [0.2.1] — 2026-08-18

### Fixed
- **Adopt no longer lists the owner as a member of their own agent.** Adopting a
  hand-built OpenClaw agent seeds members from the source bot's `allowFrom`,
  which includes the owner's own Telegram id — and the owner seat already
  carries it via pair-once, so the owner ended up listed twice (owner + member).
  Seeding now skips any Telegram id already admitted (the owner seat included),
  and dedupes repeats within the seed list. Existing split rows can be repaired
  with `scripts/link-owner-telegram.ts`.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-08-18

### Added
- **Per-agent model selection.** One AI source can now drive different agents on
  different models. Each cloud agent may pin any model from its source's
  switchable list, or follow the source default — set in **Edit → Model** (the
  row appears only for cloud sources), applied on the next Rebuild. Use a cheap
  model for simple agents and a top model for the demanding ones without
  standing up a second source. Local sources still run their single resident
  model, so the picker is hidden for them. See `docs/ai-profiles.md`.

### Changed
- **AI-source dropdowns name the source by kind, not model.** The Edit and
  Create source pickers now read e.g. `My Claude — Claude` / `Local Qwen —
  Local` instead of repeating a model id, which collided with the new per-agent
  Model picker beside it.
- `agentclaw ai <agent>` (CLI) now reports the agent's *effective* model — its
  per-agent override when set — instead of the source's default.
- README documents per-agent model selection.

### Fixed
- A per-agent model pin can no longer reach the runtime after it goes stale.
  Editing a source's model list sweeps and clears any agent pin it no longer
  offers, and `effectiveModel` falls back to the source default for any pin not
  on the current menu — closing the "green build that dies on first use" gap.
- `PATCH /v1/agents/:id` validates a combined source-switch + model request
  before any write, so a request rejected for a bad model no longer leaves the
  agent half-switched to the new source.

## [0.1.0]

Initial baseline: create and manage OpenClaw agents on local or cloud hosts,
Telegram pairing and membership, AI sources (Anthropic / Google / local Ollama,
API key or on-machine subscription), source sharing across accounts, per-agent
read-only folder mounts, agent export/import and re-hosting, snapshots, and the
web app + CLI.
